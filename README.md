# Temperature Converter Web Application

## About This Project

This project is a simple Temperature Converter web application that I built as part of my Web Development & Designing Internship under OIBSIP at Oasis Infobyte.

The main goal of this project was to understand how JavaScript works with HTML and CSS to create interactive web applications.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

---

## What This Project Does

This web application allows the user to:

- Enter a temperature value
- Select the conversion type (Celsius to Fahrenheit or Fahrenheit to Celsius)
- Click the convert button
- Instantly see the converted temperature result

---

## How It Works

I used basic HTML to create the structure of the page.
CSS is used to style the layout and make it look clean and simple.
JavaScript is used to perform the temperature conversion calculations.

The formulas used are:

Celsius to Fahrenheit:
F = (C × 9/5) + 32

Fahrenheit to Celsius:
C = (F − 32) × 5/9

JavaScript takes the user input, applies the formula, and displays the result on the screen.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I improved my understanding of:
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling in JavaScript
- Basic form input handling
- Connecting HTML, CSS and JavaScript together

This project helped me gain more confidence in building small interactive web applications.
